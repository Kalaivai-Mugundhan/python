A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom,[1]
 is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
 (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist 
 of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals 
 that enclose and protect the developing flower. 
 Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive 
 organs that produce gametophytes, which in
  flowering plants produce gametes. The male 
  gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed 
  within pollen grains produced in the anthers. 
  The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.
  [2][3] In some plants, multiple flowers occur 
  singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), and some are arranged
   in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle (inflorescence stalk).
